Fist task application done. I used Postgres RDMS for data store
I will try to work with Oracle RDMS.
- Install Oracle in my temporary account (while i don't have my own).
- Use it for data store of my application.

Done on 25.04.2017

I install and configure Oracle on my temporary account.
I configure my application config files (hibernate.cfg.xml, context.xml) for Oracle.
At first I had a problem that column name "date" is reserved word in Oracle and I couldn't
get data from table through Hibernate. I solved it to change name of column.
After that I faced with problem that I could't insert data to database
because Oracle doesn't have autoincrement feature. I solved that problem to add sequence generator for ID column in Oracle.
And also I have to change JPA annotation for generation strategy for ID field
from GenerationType.IDENTITY to GenerationType.SEQUENCE and add to annotation the name of created sequence.
Also I added in JPA annotations name of database schema otherwise Hibernate could't to detect table and sequence name.
Read about Oracle data type varchar2.
Read about Oracle math view.
Read about Oracle index's types
